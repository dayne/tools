This is a collection of random little tools I've written over the years.

Most of these things doesn't need their own project.  They are examples,
throw away apps, amusement scripts, and such.

If I've blatently grabbed code and made minor modifications to it I try
and make sure to link to the source of the code.  If you spot any funny
business please make sure you point it out to me.  Don't want funny business
going on.
